                    <p>The management of Great Blessings Christian schools, the teachers, parents, my team, students and everybody else, Good morning.</p> 

                      <p>I welcome you all to Our end of summer camp funfair in the name of God the father, Son and the holy spirit. 
                      I want to specially thank you all for taking out time and honouring us with your presence. We’re grateful for the opportunity to host you and we pray that you have a swell time and you make wonderful lasting memories with us and your loved ones. 
                      </p>

                      <p>So, Rachelle kiddies summer camp almost didn’t happen this year. I was tired, I was burned out and even frustrated because I was pouring in my heart, soul, resources and advertising like my life depended on it but results were not forthcoming. 
                      I was also saddled with a lot of responsibilities from my work place and other endeavors and it was very hard keeping up with everything at once. 
                      I had a lot going on but God told me to persist and I persisted and today, Our summer camp is closing with this event. This is one of the most difficult things I have had to do in my entire life. 
                      </p>

                      <p>We firstly had to readjust our fees from 30,000 to 45,000 naira, the price change was sudden and was considered expensive for the average plateau man. 
                      It was a lot but you parents trusted us with your resources and with the well being of your children and enrolled them still. 
                      We want to say a very big thank you. 
                      </p>

                      <p>
                      We came up with the three offers this year, the basic, the Intermidiate and the premium offers to ensure we cover a wide range of families and  you all here present took the offers, we are thankful to you for trusting us and giving your children the experience of a lifetime. 
                      </p>

                      <p>
                      During the course of the summer camp, we encountered a lot of children from different backgrounds with their individual peculiarities and we pride ourselves in learning the child’s learning and behavioral patterns and teaching them each in the way that is most convenient for them to learn in. Teaching them, encouraging them and scolding them when necessary. My team and I didn’t exactly find it easy but we’re grateful there was no record of accidents, no emergencies, no cases of theft, and when anyone forgot an item, it was found and returned the next day. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Thank you so much children too for being on your best behaviours, for loving each other, for sharing, for making each other your friends and being kind to your instructors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Thank you all so much our guests for the honor and I hope you have a swell time watching our performances and engaging in our activities for the day, may God honor you too.
